This folder contains the scripts which can be used to build Object Detection model using TensorFlow Object Detection API:

1. xml_to_csv.py : Converts annotations on in Pascal VOC formart (usually created by tools like 'LabelImg') to csv format.
2. generate_tfrecord.py : Converts csv data to tfrecord format (required by TensorFlow object detection API).

In addition to the above, we are providing a sample configuration file which is used with the model training example provided on Gradient.School AI/ML course.
